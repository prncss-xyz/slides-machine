# State Machines:

## Sometimes a Library, Always a Pattern

_by Juliette Lamarche_

---

## Scopes

I will start by making a distinction between state management and state manipulation. By state manipulation, I mean the business logic side of things,
the pure functions which maps one state to another. By state management, I mean the physical implementation of that state, including concerns such a storage and
reactivity. I will mostly focus on the state management side of things. Although examples will be with in React, the main concepts also apply on the backend, on the frond-end
outside the component tree, or with (almost) any frond-end framework or state management library.

## Update by Events vs Updates by Values

- useState vs useReducer
- technically, each can be implemented with the other
- they still capture different intentions

---

## Update by Events vs Updates by Values

### Update by Values

<Row>
  <Box>
    - useState 
    - free transitions, let consumers do whatever they want
    - symmetry between getters and setters 
    - setter can be a value or an update function 
    - optics 
    - _e.g.:_ form-like, query object
  </Box>
  <Box maxWidth="50vh" maxHeight="50vh" overflow="hidden">
    ![filter](./filter.png)
  </Box>
</Row>

## Events vs Values

### Update by Events

<Box maxWidth="40vh" maxHeight="40vh">

</Box>

---

## Events vs Values

### Update by Events

<Row>
	<Box>
		- useReducer, Redux (actions)
    - asymmetry between reads and writes (different types)
    - restricted set of allowed transitions 
    - result of an event can depend on the current state 
    - states and events have different types 
    - state machines
	</Box>
	<Box>
		```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2 
      [*] --> green 
      green --> yellow: next 
      yellow --> red: next 
      red --> green: next 
    ```
	</Box>
</Row>

---

### Events

- O.G.: [redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- well known
  - React: useReducer, useActionState
  - [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
  - [Jotai: atomWithReducer](https://jotai.org/docs/utilities/reducer) (don't use `useReducerAtom`)
- great typing
  - [@xstate/store](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-store)
  - [zustandjs/zustand-xs](https://github.com/zustandjs/zustand-xs)

    ```
    <Box>
      - initial/final states
      - make illegal states irrepresentable
      - express the succession of events
      - no business logic in the handlers
    </Box>
  </Col>
    ```typescript
    !from ./samples/loader/machine2.ts
    ```
</Row>

---

## Finite State Machines

- replace multiple flags that do not freely combine
- express a succession idea
- regroup business logic
- finite number of possible states
  - exhaustivity
  - visual communication (domain experts)
- think state then event
- domain consistency
- but limited because cannot hold data

## Extended Finite State Machines

- xState context
  - proven to work
  - *but* makes illegal context possible to express
  - do not use type information to its full potential (as a tool for thinking)
- multiple states
  - state type and state payload state are coupled
  - less known

# State Explosion

<Box py="3">
![state explosion](./state-explosion.webp)
</Box>

- as complexity grows, usual clean code concerns araise ("god machine" as "god function" or "god class")
  - multiple responsibilities
  - multiple abstraction levels
- in a typical application, number of independent state will multiply for each component
  - exponentional growth

---

# State Explosion

- use many machines in one framework
- connecting
  - have effects or messages connect to another state machine
  - xState (actor model), useReducer
- composing, statecharts
  - composition is a operation that takes simple machines to create a more complex one
  - "Harel, D. (1987). A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems. Science of Computer Programming, 231–274".
  - was intended to be the entry point of an application
  - visual programmation
  - xState, redux, useContext + useReducer
  - types of composition
    - product (similar to Redux' slice pattern)
    - hierarchical
    - sum
    - history

---

# Serialization

- why?
  - persistance
  - transport
  - dev tools
- how
  - serializable core (vs computed state)
  - replay
    - merging decentralized updates
- unreachable states
  - `plusTwo`
  - code smell (make illegal states irrepresentable)

---

# Use Cases

- component logic
  - reusable across frameworks: [Zag](https://zagjs.com/)
- optimistic updates
  - have same machine on client and server
  - but have different effects implementations
- embedded systems
- automata
  - multiple step fetching
  - front-end: out of tree
  - back-end

# Library vs Pattern

## Pattern

<Row>
  <Box>
  - no learning curve
  - fewer dependencies
  - less descriptive

# Library vs Pattern

## xState

<Row>
  <Box>
  - industry standard
  - very good devtools (visual)
  - tools for testing (solved a problem they created by not being pure enough)
  - complete
  - context
  - reactive system is redundant with front-end framework

# Library vs Pattern

## Constellar

<Row>
  <Box>
  - personal project
  - not production ready
  - clear separation of concerns
    - jotai integration
  - multiple state (vs context)
  - optics
  - would love your feedback and your stars (but mostly you feedback)
  - maybe we can make it production ready together!

## Some smells

<Row>
  <Box>
  - you can freely transition from any state to any other state (the transition graph is saturated)
    - use a simple state, update by value
  - your machine mixes different concerns or abstraction levels
    - use multiple machines (connect or compose)
  - your machine has junk states that do not convey useful information
    - use messages
  - some combination of states should never happen in your application
    - merge different states (machines or values) into a single machine
  - some succession of states should never happen
    - use a state machine
  - Happy Smelling!
