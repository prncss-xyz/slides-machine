# State Machines:

## Sometimes a Library, Always a Pattern

_by Juliette Lamarche_

---

## Scopes

I will start by making a distinction between physical and logical state management. By state logical state management, I mean the business logic side of things,
the pure functions which maps one state to another. By physical state management, I mean the actual implementation of that state, including concerns such a storage and
reactivity. I will mostly focus on the logical side of things. Although examples will be with in React, the main concepts also apply on the backend, on the frond-end
outside the component tree, or with (almost) any frond-end framework or state management library.

## Update by Events vs Updates by Values

- useState vs useReducer
- technically, each can be implemented with the other
- they still capture different intentions

---

## Update by Events vs Updates by Values

### Update by Values

<Row>
  <div>
    - useState 
    - free transitions, let consumers do whatever they want
    - symmetry between getters and setters 
    - setter can be a value or an update function 
    - optics 
    - _e.g.:_ form-like, query object
  </div>
  <Box width="40vh">
    ![filter](./filter.png)
  </Box>
</Row>

---

## Events vs Values

### Update by Events

<div style={{ width: '40vh' }}>
	![traffic lights](./lights.jpg)
</div>

---

## Events vs Values

### Update by Events

<Row>
	<div>
		- useReducer, Redux (actions)
    - asymmetry between reads and writes (different types)
    - restricted set of allowed transitions 
    - result of an event can depend on the current state 
    - states and events have different types 
    - state machines
	</div>
	<div>
		```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2 
      [*] --> green 
      green --> yellow: next 
      yellow --> red: next 
      red --> green: next 
    ```
	</div>
</Row>

---

### Events

- O.G.: [redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- well known
  - React: useReducer, useActionState
  - [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
  - [Jotai: atomWithReducer](https://jotai.org/docs/utilities/reducer) (don't use `useReducerAtom`)
- great typing
  - [@xstate/store](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-store)
  - [zustandjs/zustand-xs](https://github.com/zustandjs/zustand-xs)
  - [Constellar: simple state machine](https://prncss-xyz.github.io/constellar/docs/machines/simple-state)

  const [error, setError] = useState(false)
  // ...
}
```
<Row>
  |             | _loading_ |          |

        ```
      </div>
    </Row>
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '15em' }}>
      - this part of business logic is expressed in the handlers 
        - lack of cohesion
        - easy to be inconsistent
    </div>
  </Row>
</Row>

## Finite State Machines

### Loader

<RowCode>
  <Col level={2}>
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
      [*] --> loading
      loading --> error: error
      loading --> success: success
      error --> [*]
      success --> [*]
    ```
    <div>
      - make illegal states irrepresentable
      - express the succession of events
      - no business logic in the handlers
    </div>
  </Col>
    ```typescript
    !from ./samples/loader/machine.ts
    ```
</RowCode>

---

## Finite State Machines

- replace multiple flags that do not freely combine
- express a succession idea
- regroup business logic
- finite number of possible states
  - exhaustivity
  - visual communication (domain experts)
- think state then event
- domain consistency
- but limited because cannot hold data

### Turnstile Gate

<Row>
	```mermaid

    [*] --> locked 
    locked --> unlocked: pay 
    unlocked --> locked: push 
  ```
	<Card>
    <Turnstile />
  </Card>
</Row>

---

## Finite State Machines

### Turnstile Gate

<Row>
  <div>
  - pure function
  - state then event
    - cohesion (should not accept a payment when you can push the gate)
    - a tool for dealing with human complexity (vs mathematical complexity)
  - state switch
    - has no default case
    - every state type must be handeled
  - event switch 
    - has default case
    - not every event type will trigger a transition
    - exetensibility
  </div>
  ```typescript
  !from ./samples/turnstile/machine.ts
  ```
</Row>

---

## Finite State Machines

### Turnstile Gate

<Row>
  <div>
    - simply pass the machine to `useReducer` hook
    - `canPay` has zero knowledge of the transition graph
  </div>
  ```tsx 
  !from ./samples/turnstile/component.tsx 7:21
  ```
</Row>

  ```
</Row>

---

## Extended Finite State Machines

- xState context
  - proven to work
  - *but* makes illegal context possible to express
  - do not use type information to its full potential (as a tool for thinking)
- multiple states
  - state type and state payload state are coupled
  - less known

---

## Extended Finite State Machines

### Timer

<Row>
 	```mermaid
   stateDiagram-v2
     [*] --> stopped 
     stopped --> running: toggle 
     stopped --> stopped: reset
     running --> stopped: toggle 
     running --> running: reset
   ```
   <Card>
     <Timer />
   </Card>
</Row>

<div>
  - `reset` is a self-transition
</div>

---

## Extended Finite State Machines

### Timer

<Row>
  <div>
    - `elapsed` and `since` have same type but different semantics
    - events have a `now` parameter so reducer can be a pure function
      - easier to test
  </div>
  ```typescript
  !from ./samples/timer/machine.ts
  ```
</Row>

---

## Extended Finite State Machines

### Timer

<Row>
  <div>
    - getter function to compute the displayed time
    - ideally, we should colocate partial definitions of the getter with each state transition function (a library would solve this)
  </div>
  ```typescript
  !from ./samples/timer/count.ts
  ```
</Row>

---

## Extended Finite State Machines

### Timer

<Row>
  <div>
    - `next` has zero knowledge of the transition graph
  </div>
  ```tsx
  !from ./samples/timer/component.tsx 8:23
  ```
</Row>

    payment --> unlocked: success
    payment --> locked: error
    unlocked --> locked: push 
  ```
  <Card>
    <Turnstile2 />
  </Card>
</Row>

<div>
- `payment` state is a meaningful waiting state

# State Explosion

<Box width="10em">
  ![state explosion](./state-explosion.webp)
</Box>

<div>
- as complexity grows, usual clean code concerns araise ("god machine" as "god function" or "god class")
  - multiple responsibilities
  - multiple abstraction levels
- in a typical application, number of independent state will multiply for each component
  - exponentional growth
</div>

---

# State Explosion

- use many machines in one framework
- connecting
  - have effects or messages connect to another state machine
  - xState (actor model), useReducer
- composing, statecharts
  - composition is a operation that takes simple machines to create a more complex one
  - "Harel, D. (1987). A Visual Formalism for Complex Systems. Science of Computer Programming, 231–274".
  - was intended to be the entry point of an application
  - visual programmation
  - xState, redux, useContext + useReducer
  - types of composition
    - product (similar to Redux' slice pattern)
    - hierarchical
    - sum
    - history

---

# Serialization

- why?
  - persistance
  - transport
  - dev tools
- how
  - serializable core (vs computed state)
  - replay
    - merging decentralized updates
- unreachable states
  - `plusTwo`
  - code smell (make illegal states irrepresentable)

---

# Use Cases

- component logic
  - reusable across frameworks: [Zag](https://zagjs.com/)
- optimistic updates
  - have same machine on client and server
  - but have different effects implementations
- embedded systems
- automata
  - multiple step fetching
  - front-end: out of tree
  - back-end

# Library vs Pattern

## Pattern

<Row>
  <div>
  - no learning curve
  - fewer dependencies
  - less descriptive
  </div>
</Row>

---

# Library vs Pattern

## xState

<Row>
  <div>
  - industry standard
  - very good devtools (visual)
  - tools for testing (solved a problem they created by not being pure enough)
  - complete
  - context
  - reactive system is redundant with front-end framework
  </div>
  <QR name="XState" href="https://xstate.js.org/" />

# Library vs Pattern

## Robot

<Row>
  <div>
  - lightweight (1kb)
  - context
  - reactive system is redundant with front-end framework
  </div>
  <QR name="Robot" href="https://thisrobot.life/" />
</Row>

# Library vs Pattern

## Constellar

<Row>
  <div>
  - personal project
  - not production ready
  - clear separation of concerns
    - jotai integration
  - multiple state (vs context)
  - optics
  - would love your feedback and your stars (but mostly you feedback)
  - maybe we can make it production ready together!

## Some Smells

<TwoColsTbl>
| :poop: | :rose: |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| some succession of states should never happen | use a state machine |
| any state leads to any state (the transition graph is saturated) | use a simple state, update by value |
| there is only one state | use a simple reducer function |
| some combination of states should never happen in your application | merge different states (machines or values) into a single machine |
| the machine mixes different concerns or abstraction levels | use multiple machines (connect or compose) |
| the machine has junk states that do not convey useful information | use messages |
</TwoColsTbl>

**Happy Smelling!**
